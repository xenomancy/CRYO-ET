THIS IS BASICALLY A WRITE UP FOR THE MACHINE-LEARNING MODELS WE ARE GOING TO USE IN THIS PAPER:-
For predicting protein labels on cryo-ET or cryo-EM images, consider the following machine learning algorithms and techniques:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
2. 3D CNNs
3. Transfer Learning
4. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
5. Transformers for Vision
6. Autoencoders
7. Multi-Instance Learning (MIL)
8. Reinforcement Learning
9. Ensemble Learning
10. Generative Models
