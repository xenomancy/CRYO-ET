THIS IS A WRITE-UP FOR THE MACHINE-LEARNING MODELS WE ARE GOING TO USE IN THIS PAPER:-
For predicting protein labels on cryo-ET or cryo-EM images, consider the following machine-learning algorithms and techniques:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are well-suited for image data as they excel in capturing spatial hierarchies. Architectures like ResNet, EfficientNet, or U-Net for segmentation and classification tasks.

2. 3D CNNs: Cryo-ET data often involve 3D volumetric data instead of 2D images. Models like VNet or 3D-ResNet handle volumetric image data effectively.

3. Transfer Learning: pre-trained models can provide a good starting point if labeled cryo-EM or cryo-ET datasets are limited. Fine-tuning pre-trained networks on your specific dataset.

4. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Cryo-EM/ET data can sometimes be represented as graphs (e.g., protein structures). Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for tasks where proteins can be represented as nodes and interactions as edges.

5. Transformers for Vision: Cryo-EM/ET data can sometimes be represented as graphs (e.g., protein structures). ViT or hybrid CNN-ViT models

6. Autoencoders:  Useful for unsupervised learning and feature extraction. Variants like Convolutional Autoencoders for dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection.

7. Multi-Instance Learning (MIL): Useful for datasets where labels are assigned to collections of images rather than individual images. Explore MIL frameworks tailored to biomedical imaging.

8. Reinforcement Learning: In cases where iterative refinement of the predicted structure is needed. Application of RL to refine noisy predictions.

9. Ensemble Learning: Combining predictions from multiple models often boosts performance. Techniques like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost) for simpler tasks or as components of larger frameworks.

10. Generative Models: For augmenting datasets and predicting missing regions in cryo-EM/ET data. GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) or diffusion models for data augmentation.
