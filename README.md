# CRYO-ET
Understanding protein complexes in their cellular environment—like oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in red blood cells— is essential for advancing disease treatment. Cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) creates stunning 3D images at near-atomic detail, allowing us to gain valuable insights into protein interactions within their dynamic natural environment.
